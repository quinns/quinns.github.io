I've been using [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) images more and more lately, in my front-end work. They're so wonderful for line art logos, icons, and all manner of art that you wish to remain razor-sharp at any resolution. <!--more--> However, it turns out SVG can do **so much more** than just rendering static images. Animation, masking, *type on a curve*, you name it. Pretty amazing.

Check out this [sweet slide deck](http://talks.brennaobrien.com/svg/) from [Brenna O'Brien](http://brennaobrien.com/), demonstrating a whole bunch of stuff that had me saying, *"SVG can do that!?"*
