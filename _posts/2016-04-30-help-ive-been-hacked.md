I was fortunate to give an impromptu talk on web server security and how to recover from a hacked site. <!--more--> Presented at [One Day Labs](http://onedaylabs.com) (formerly [WIMPspace](http://wimpspace.com)) in Santa Rosa, California. This was a two-part talk, with the first portion by [Jill Osborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-osborne-69a2754) of the [IC Network](https://www.ic-network.com/). The embed below jumps right to where I start talking, but I recommend you rewind to the beginning and watch the whole thing. It's worth it.
